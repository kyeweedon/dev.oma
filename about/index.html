Extensive testing has been undertaken in salt and fresh water in Australian conditions before we have committed to this product.</p>
						<p>The 2012 TITAN product offering is based on simple but robust 2-strokes from 3hp to 90hp outboard motors with short and long shaft configuration, remote control and power trim as per the schedule attached. While this initial product offering is with mature technology in reed valve carburetion, the units feature current industry standard safety features such as lanyard emergency stop and in gear starting protection.</p>
